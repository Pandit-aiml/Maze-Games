#MAZE GAMES
The Spaceship Maze Game uses Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest path through a maze. The spaceship navigates from the start to the destination by calculating the minimum-cost route while avoiding obstacles. A Tkinter-based GUI visually shows the maze, spaceship movement, and the optimal path, demonstrating real-world applications of shortest path algorithms in navigation and AI.
